# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Apr 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about update and delete on the CRUD operations for MongoDB.

**Thoughts:** I thought it was pretty easy to learn about the CRUD operations for MongoDB. It was pretty similar to the CRUD operations using SQLite on Rails.

## Day 2: Apr 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed and used Mongoose to create models and validate data.

**Thoughts:** Very easy and straightforward to create models and validate data. I see similarities between how Mongoose and Rails validate data. Having fun learning new things and wanting more of it!

## Day 3: Apr 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Recap on REST API. Also installed and used Postman to test endpoints for task app.

**Thoughts:** At first had problems with creating documents into mongodb but found out that I didn't start it up. REST API was a recap. Using mongoose and express, I inserted documents into mongodb database. Having fun learning new and old things.

## Day 4: Apr 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: In Node.js, used REST API to read documents from mongodb database. Also learned about promise chaining and its syntax.

**Thoughts:** REST API part was easy since I went through them so many times in class and projects. Promise chaining was something new to me and it made code look so much cleaner than nesting promises so many levels deep. I enjoy just programming!

## Day 5: Apr 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about async and await.

**Thoughts:** Async and await made the code cleaner because of less callbacks in the task app routes. I know that I can use these keywords to clean up my projects from school using promises. So much to refactoring to do, so little time!

## Day 6: Apr 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Recap on the U and D of CRUD operation. Also separated route files in my task app.

**Thoughts:** The update as usual is complex. Will have to come back to the update operation to understand it more. It was nice to have separation of concerns for the routes because of how long the index file was getting on the task app.

## Day 7: Apr 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Used bcryptjs to hash passwords of users.

**Thoughts:** A recap from my Rails days except how to use in JavaScript. Also used the pre hook middlware to hash passwords before saving.

## Day 8: Apr 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JWT (JSON Web Token). Also disabled routes in my task app by using express middleware.

**Thoughts:** JWT authentication is pretty new to me. I am used to using HTTP cookies to authenticate users. Must delve deeper into JWT. I finally understand how middleware works with the use of express routes.

## Day 9: Apr 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about accepting authentication tokens for creating and logging in users. Also learned about advanced Postman techniques such as setting environmental variables for the url. Also learned about logging out the user by clearing the authentication tokens.

**Thoughts:** Learning about accepting JWT authentication tokens was challenging. I am used to session cookies to authenticate. I see the benefit of using JWT authentication because these tokens are saved in the client side. Session cookies uses server memory so if many users logs in the server may slow down. Better techniques in Postman helped me streamline the process so that I don't have to do redundant tasks such as setting the url with minor differences for each REST route.
